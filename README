A simple Go wrapper for parts of flint2
(http://www.flintlib.org).

The code is GPL 2 licensed (as flint2 itself is GPL licensed).
The text of the GPL can be found in the file GPL.

Currently only some functions  are wrapped. It should be
straight-forward to add other functions when the need arises.

There is currently basically no test code. This will change.

We assume a 'weekly' build of Go.
