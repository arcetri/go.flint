A simple Go wrapper for parts of flint2
(http://www.flintlib.org).

The code is GPL 2 licensed (as flint2 itself is GPL licensed).
The text of the GPL can be found in the file GPL.

Currently only some functions  are wrapped. It should be
straight-forward to add other functions when the need arises.

There is currently basically no test code. This will change.

To compile and use go.flint you need the FLINT2, MPIR and MPFR
libraries and header files installed in places where gcc and
ld will find them.

To run an example change to one of the subdirectories of examples/
and do

  go build .

This should compile the necessary parts of go.flint and produce a
binary program.
